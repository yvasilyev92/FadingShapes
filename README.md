# FadingShapes
Android app allows users to draw random colored random shapes on a canvas.
Project 4 - Fading Shapes.

The	purpose	of	this	project	is	to	give	you	practice	with	the	abstract	factory	software	design	
pattern, and	practice	extending	code	that	you	have	already written.		Reuse	of	existing	code	
is	an	important	part	of	object	oriented	design.		

App	Description
This	app	uses	buttons	to	trigger	drawing	shapes	on	a	relative	layout.		As	
new	shapes	are	added,	the	previously	drawn	shapes	fade	away. Now,	however,	there	are	
styles	that	the	shapes	can	be	drawn	in.		Styles	are	defined	by	a	combination	of	a	border	
color	and	a	fill	color.		All	shapes	with	a	particular	border	and	fill	color	combination	are	said	
to	have	the	same	style.
The	new	app	draws	shapes	randomly	sized	rectangles	and	circles	as	before,	but	now	the	
shapes	are	drawn	in	the	current	style.		A	STYLE	button	should	be	added	that	will	allow	the	
user	to	change	styles.		When	this	button	is	pressed,	the	next	style	is	chosen.		The	button	
loops	back	around	to	the	start	of	the list	of	styles.		As	before,	pressing	the	CLEAR	button	
removes	all	shapes	from	the	canvas.		A	count	of	the	number	of	each	type	of	shape	is	
displayed	at	the	top	of	the	screen,	as	well	as	the	name	of	the	next	style	to	be	created.
